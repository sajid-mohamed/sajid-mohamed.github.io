  abstract = {Image-Based Control (IBC) systems have a long
sample period. Sensing in these systems consists of computeintensive image processing algorithms whose response times
are dependent on image workload. IBC systems are typically
designed for the worst-case workload that results in a long
sample period and hence suboptimal quality-of-control (QoC).
This worst-case based design is further considered for mapping
of controller tasks and allocating platform resources, resulting
in significant resource over-provisioning. Our design philosophy
is to sample as fast as possible to optimise QoC for a given
platform allocation, and for this, we present a structured design
flow. Workload variations determine how fast we can sample
and we model this dynamic behaviour using the concept of
workload scenarios. Our choice of scenario-aware dataflow as the
formal model for our application enables us to: i) model dynamic
behaviour, analyse timing, and optimally map application tasks to
the platform for maximising the effective utilisation of allocated
resources, ii) relate throughput of the dataflow graph to the
sample period, and thus combine dataflow analysis and mapping
with control design parameters and QoC to identify system
scenarios, and iii) to efficiently implement a run-time mechanism
that manages necessary dynamic reconfiguration between system
scenarios. Our results show that our design approach outperforms the worst-case based design with respect to optimising
QoC and maximising effective resource utilisation.}
