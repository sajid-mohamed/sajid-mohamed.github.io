<!-- <font face="helvetica" size="3"><p align="justify">Hi, this is my official website!</p></font> -->

I am a Principal Software Engineer (R&D Innovation) at ITEC, Nexperia from July 2021.

Prior to that I was a doctoral candidate in the [Electronic Systems group](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/electronic-systems/) of the Department of Electrical Engineering at [Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/). My doctoral research focused on the model-based design of image-based control systems in resource-constrained domains such as automotive. I was part of the [FitOptiVis](https://fitoptivis.eu/) project and was an Early-Stage Researcher in the [oCPS](http://ocps-itn.eu/) project.

I graduated as an electrical & electronics engineer with a passion for embedded systems, robotics, microprocessors and microcontrollers from [National Insitute of Technology (NIT) Calicut](http://nitc.ac.in/) in 2012.

This passion led me to pursue my Masters' in Embedded Controls & Software at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in/). It is during my masters' that I became fascinated with formal methods in design, modelling and analysis of embedded systems. I got involved in a collaborative sponsored project on Architecture-aware timing analysis and optimization of safety-critical automotive software (AUTOSAFE).
I was then awarded the prestigious DAAD scholarship to pursue my masters' thesis at the [Institute of Real-time Computer Systems](https://www.ei.tum.de/rcs/startseite/) at TU Munich, Germany. Here, I had worked on Timing analysis in automotive systems in collaboration with [Inchron GmbH](https://www.inchron.com/).

I realised my love for research and decided to pursue my career in research. After post graduation, I continued to work on the AUTOSAFE project until its completion. I came across challenging problems faced in the formal validation and certification of automotive systems and learned of more fundamental issues faced in cyber-physical system design.

An opportunity to research in this direction arose with the oCPS (Platform-aware Model-driven Optimization of Cyber-Physical Systems) project, which I gladly accepted. After the successful completion of this project, I worked in the FitOptiVis (From the cloud to the edge â€“ smart IntegraTion and OPtimisation Technologies for highly efficient Image and VIdeo processing Systems) project from November 2019 to May 2021.
